# Progressive Web App Workshop Starter

This app is a starter project for converting a standard website to a Progressive Web App using `sw-precache-webpack-plugin` and other techniques to optimize the UI for smaller file sizes and better performance.

## NOTE: This source is _NOT_ a PWA ... yet.

The source code on the `master` branch is a starter app for a workshop, and no PWA features are enabled.
